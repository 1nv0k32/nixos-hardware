= Dell XPS 15 7590 =
*Mostly copied from 15-9550

== Tested Hardware ==

* CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK
* RAM: 32 GB
* HDD: 1 TiB SSD
* Screen: 15" 4k (3840âœ•2160)
* Input: Touchscreen and trackpad.

== Firmware Configuration ==

Not much tweaking of NixOS itself was needed. But we currently cannot automate the firmware setup, so this must be done by hand.

=== Before installation ===

These settings are needed both for booting the final install, and installer itself. Therefore, they must be done first.

* ''Disable Secure Boot (but keep UEFI Boot).'' Thankfully doing so is as easy as changing any other simple setting.

* ''Disable Intel hardware RAID and use AHCI instead.'' Intel doesn't seem to provide a working linux driver for this.  (If you just have SSD it's pointless and just slows things down needlessly anyways.)

=== After installation ===

* ''Add systemd-boot to UEFI boot list.'' The (uneditable anyways) settings mapping drive UUIDs to HD* work fine.

=== Optional ===

* ''Update BIOS.'' According to Reddit, this helps with battery life.

== Firmware updates ==

This device is supported by [https://fwupd.org/ fwupd].

You may use <code>fwupdmgr</code> to perform firmware updates.

== Power management ==

Deep sleep is preferred to the default S2 sleep mode, in order to reduce battery draining during suspend.
